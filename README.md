# FlexBoxDemo

* Notes 

# Flex
- 'display:flex' will move items along the main axis
- flex-direction column will make the main axis vertical
- flex-direction row will make the main horizontal
- The flex direction is set horizontal by default, so rows is not necessary

# Justify-Content:
- flex-start will align items on left side of main axis
- flex-end will align items on right side of main axis
- center will aligns items in the middle
- space-between will evenly space the items until they fill the container
- space-around is similar to space-between, but will leave space on the edges of the items
- space-evenly will do the same thing as space around, but leaves the same space in between the edges and between items
